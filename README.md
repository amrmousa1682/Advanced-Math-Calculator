# Advanced Math Calculator

This is a C++ program that provides advanced mathematical operations such as evaluating expressions in infix, postfix, or prefix notation, converting between these notations, and calculating the modulus, greatest common divisor (GCD), and least common multiple (LCM) of two numbers. The program also includes the ability to encrypt and decrypt text using the Caesar cipher encryption method.

## Building

To build the program, you will need to have CMake installed on your computer. Once you have CMake installed, you can use the following commands to build the program:

```
cmake build ./
make
```

This will generate the build files and build the program. You can then run the program using the following command:

```
./Advanced-Math-Calculator
```

## Usage

Upon launching the program, you will be presented with a menu of options to choose from. You can select the appropriate option to perform the desired mathematical or encryption-related function.


When entering a mathematical expression, be sure to separate each operand and operator with a space. For example, to evaluate the expression "3 + 4", you would enter it as "3 + 4", not "3+4".
